# Python Script Template

This sample repo contains the recommended structure for a Python script. In this example, we use `pytest` to test features in your script. 

For a more in-depth tutorial, see our [Python tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial).

The code in this repo aims to follow Python style guidelines as outlined in [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).

## Running the Sample

- Open the template folder in VS Code (**File** > **Open Folder...**)
- Select a Python interpreter using **Python: Select Interpreter** in the Command Palette (**View > Command Palette**)
- Run `main.py` using the Play Button in the top right corner or by selecting **Python > Python File in Terminal** from the context menu or Command Palette
- To test the Python code, create a Python virtual environment using the **Python: Create Environment** command found in the Command Palette. Ensure you install dependencies found in the `dev-requirements.txt` file
- Ensure your newly created environment is selected using the **Python: Select Interpreter** command found in the Command Palette
- Navigate to the Test Panel to configure your Python test or by triggering the **Python: Configure Tests** command from the Command Palette
- Run tests in the Test Panel or by clicking the Play Button next to the individual tests in the `test_date_time.py` file
